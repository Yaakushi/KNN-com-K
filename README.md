# KNN - k Nearest Neighbor

Implementation of KNN in C for the "Image Processing and Pattern Recognition" class from UFPR.

## Input files

Both train and test files should start with the following line, without the brackets:

```[number of train/test cases] [num of characteristics]```

Then, each line should contain all the characteristics for one case (as a floating point values), as well as the real label for that case as the last parameter (as a integer).
